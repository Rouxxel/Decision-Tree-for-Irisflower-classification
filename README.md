## Project description

This project implements a Supervised Machine Learning model using a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of an Iris flower—Setosa, Virginica, or Versicolor based on its physical characteristics. There is a Powerpoint presentation that better explains it and serves as documentation

## 📊 Dataset Description

The model is trained on the classic **Iris Flower Dataset**, which is a widely used benchmark in classification problems. Below are the key characteristics of the dataset:

- 🌺 **Three species of Iris flowers** are included:
  - *Iris-setosa*
  - *Iris-versicolor*
  - *Iris-virginica*

- 📈 **150 data points** in total:
  - 50 samples of each species.

- 🧾 **Sorted dataset**:
  - Samples are grouped by class:
    - Rows 1–50: *Setosa*
    - Rows 51–100: *Versicolor*
    - Rows 101–150: *Virginica*

- 📋 **6 columns**:
  1. `Id`: Unique identifier for each sample  
  2. `SepalLengthCm`: Length of the sepal in centimeters  
  3. `SepalWidthCm`: Width of the sepal in centimeters  
  4. `PetalLengthCm`: Length of the petal in centimeters  
  5. `PetalWidthCm`: Width of the petal in centimeters  
  6. `Species`: The class label (target variable)

- 🔍 **Type of problem**:
  - **Supervised Learning**
  - **Multinomial Classification** (3 distinct categories)
